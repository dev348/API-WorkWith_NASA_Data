# Surface Temperature Analysis with NASA_Data
The GISS Surface Temperature Analysis ver. 4 (GISTEMP v4) is an estimate of global surface temperature change. Graphs and tables are updated around the middle of every month using current data files from NOAA GHCN v4 (meteorological stations) and ERSST v5 (ocean areas), combined as described in our publications Hansen et al. (2010) and Lenssen et al. (2019). These updated files incorporate reports for the previous month and also late reports and corrections for earlier months.

## Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies (Land-Ocean Temperature Index, L-OTI)
The following are plain-text files in tabular format of temperature anomalies, i.e. deviations from the corresponding 1951-1980 means.

Global-mean monthly, seasonal, and annual means, 1880-present
Northern Hemisphere-mean monthly, seasonal, and annual means, 1880-present
Southern Hemisphere-mean monthly, seasonal, and annual means, 1880-present
## Zonal annual means, 1880-present, updated through most recent complete years upto 2021
